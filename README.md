# TennisProject
I volunteered to take on the task of cleaning up my Tennis Coach's Club database. Here is how I will be proposing my services to her. 

<h1>Tennis Club Database</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project was designed for my Tennis coach who came to me with data management struggles. Her data is incomplete and she wants to update her emailing lists with separate skill levels and more customer metrics, marketing with merch partners, and events each club member would likely attend. <br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>JSON</b>

<h2>Environment Used</h2>

- <b>AWS via Mac</b> (21H2)

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>
